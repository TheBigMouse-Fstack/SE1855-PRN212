# ProductStore WPF Application

## Introduction
This project is a WPF application developed for ProductStore to manage products using Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations. It uses .NET Core and C# with an in-memory database (a `List` collection) to persist product data. The application implements the Repository pattern and uses LINQ to Object for querying data.

## Lab Objectives
In this lab, you will:
- Use Visual Studio.NET to create a WPF application and a Class Library (.dll) project.
- Create a `List` for persisting product data and use LINQ to Object to find items.
- Implement data passing in the WPF application.
- Apply the Repository pattern in the project.
- Add CRUD action methods to the WPF application.
- Run and test the WPF application actions.
